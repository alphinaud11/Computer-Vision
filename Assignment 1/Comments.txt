Before quantization:
- The original image has a smooth transition between colors as there are plenty of colors to choose from (64343).

After quantization with range 10:
- The number of colors are reduced from 64343 to 1062, so we notice some edges in the background that weren't present before.

After quantization with range 20:
- The number of colors are reduced from 64343 to 231, The edges are more clear in the output image.

After quantization with range 30:
- The number of colors are reduced from 64343 to 89, false contours appear in the output image that weren't present in the original image.
