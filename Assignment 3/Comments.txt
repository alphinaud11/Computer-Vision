Image 1 (Moon):
- Segmenting the original image here produced the best output because the whole moon is segmented as Object 
(White) and the rest are background (Black). However, applying histogram equalization on the image before 
segmenting made the segmentation worse, because parts of the moon are shown as background (Black).

Image 2 (Boat):
- Segmenting the original image shows the boat as background (Black) while everything else as Object (White) 
which should be the opposite. After segmenting the equalized image, the output is still not satisfying.

Image 3 (Forest):
- Segmenting the original image shows the sky and its reflection on the water as Object (White) while everything 
else is Background (Black) which should be the opposite. After segmenting the equalized image, the output got a 
little better.

Image 4 (Car):
- Segmenting the original image here produced a good result. However, applying histogram equalization on the 
image before segmenting made the segmentation much better.

Image 5 (Chain):
- Segmenting the original image here doesn't really differentiate between the chain and the ground. Applying 
histogram equalization before segmenting did not make a noticable change.
